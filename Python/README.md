# Guidance

Python files should contain the following minimal information:

```#!/usr/bin/env python

# Standard Library imports

# 3rd Party packages

# local source

Example:

import os    # standard librar
import requests  # 3rd party package

```

Name the code snippets contextually to what the represent for clarity.
