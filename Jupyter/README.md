# Guidance

Jupyter notebooks support a variety of formats.  You can find those formats by navigating to **File -> Download As**. You'll want to export your notebook as a Jupyter Interactive Notebook (.ipynb file format) to share with the community.

If you drop a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file in the repository, it'll be automatically rendered directly in the browser after its accept.  That will make it easier for others to see and understand your notebook.
